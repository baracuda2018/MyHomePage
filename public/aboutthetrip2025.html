<h1>About my trip with my brother to Viet Nam 03/2025</h1>
<p>The purpose of this trip is to visit my brother-current live in VietNam, having colon cancer
   at stage 4 - uncurable, 22 times chemo treatment with a few more times to go before pausing for
   body rest, a period of time in one month. After period of resting, re-examine CT scan, ultra sound and physical blood 
   draw to evaluate the condition of the treatment. We hope that he will continue strive hard in his way with the support of 
   his familly and from all of us in the US.</p>

 <p>While he is still able to talk and concious about life, we don't want to miss that time frame.
</p>
