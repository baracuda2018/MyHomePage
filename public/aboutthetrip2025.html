<!-- <h1>About my trip with my brother to Viet Nam 03/2025</h1>
<p>The purpose of this trip to visit Viet Nam, to see my brother whom having colon cancer at stage 3 then 4-uncurable per 
   Doctor statements, already went through 22 times chemo treatments, and a few more times to go before pausing for
   body rest-in a month. After that, re-examine with CT scan, ultra sound and physical blood draw to evaluate the presen
   condition...based on the test results. We hope that he will continue strive hard in his way with the support of his
   familly and from all of relatives in the US.</p>

 <p>While he is still able to talk and concious about life, we don't want to miss that time frame.
